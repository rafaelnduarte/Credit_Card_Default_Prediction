One of the most problematic areas for banks, funding bodies, and businessmen is the default rate of their clients.

Analyzing whether a person will follow through with their financial responsibilities or not is extremely important and can cause a big impact on the balance of the institutions. Solutions have been developed and improved to minimize default risk.

Latin America's biggest Fintech, Nubank, is the one that has been shining the brightest when it comes to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence solutions.

The dataset analyzed in this project is part of a competition proposed by the Startup to reveal new talents and prospects for the Fintech.


> GOAL: Create a model that provides the probability of credit card default of the clients.



The model is expected to be able to decrease the company's financial losses while minimizing false positives.
